Components: Arduino UNO, PIR Sensor, LED, Jumper Wires(male to male, female to male), Bread Board.  

About the project: This setup simulates a simple Cyber-Physical System(CPS) of controlling an LED(physical counterpart) with Graphical UI(cyber counterpart).  

CPS system only works on actual hardware, cannot be simulated (wokwi etc).  
Run code.cpp first, then run interface.py.  

Debugging:
- connect the LED with a resistor.
- make sure the connections are correct.
- make sure the pin modes are set correctly(LED pin set to output, PIR Sensor set to input).
- make sure the components are not faulty.
