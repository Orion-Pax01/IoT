Components: 
Arduino UNO, Potentiometer, Jumper Wires(male to male or female to male), Bread Board.

About the project: 
We have created an Arduino project that generates an alert when the Potentiometer value exceeds a specified threshold.

Debugging:
- make sure the connections are correct.
- make sure the pin modes are set correctly(potentiometer pin should be set to input).
- make sure the components are not faulty.
